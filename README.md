I have done till here. This is all in .md format. now continue and modify this and give me a new .md file # Stock-Price-Forecasting-using-Financial-and-Twitter-Data

## Overview

This project is designed to integrate **stock market data analysis**, **sentiment analysis of tweets**, and **forecasting of stock prices** using traditional statistical models like **ARIMA** and advanced machine learning models such as **GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)**. 
The system sources data from **MySQL** (for historical stock prices), **MongoDB** (for storing tweets related to stock tickers), and **Twitter** (for real-time sentiment analysis). 
The overall goal is to predict future stock prices while analyzing public sentiment towards different stocks based on Twitter data.


## Prerequisites

To run the project, you'll need the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **MySQL** (for stock price data)
- **MongoDB** (for tweet data storage)
- **Kafka** (for real-time streaming)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for data analysis)
- **Required Python Libraries** (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Features

- **Data Integration**: 
    - Stock market data fetched from **MySQL** for historical prices.
    - Tweet data fetched and stored in **MongoDB** for analysis.
  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: 
    - **VADER** and **HuggingFace** are used for sentiment analysis of tweets.
  
- **Stock Price Forecasting**: 
    - **ARIMA** and **GRU** models are applied for forecasting future stock prices based on historical data.

- **Performance Benchmarking**: 
    - **YCSB** is used to benchmark and compare the performance of **MySQL** and **MongoDB** in terms of throughput and latency.

- **Real-Time Streaming with Kafka**: 
    - Stream tweet data to analyze real-time sentiment and correlate it with stock price trends.

- **Interactive Dashboard**: 
    - **Dash** is used for creating an interactive dashboard where users can view stock price forecasts and sentiment trends.



## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tashi-2004/Stock-Price-Forecasting-using-Financial-and-Twitter-Data.git
   cd Stock-Price-Forecasting-using-Financial-and-Twitter-Data

# Setup Instructions

## Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Set Up MySQL

1. Create a database `stockdb` in MySQL.
2. Import the historical stock prices into the `stockdb` database.

## Set Up MongoDB

1. Import tweet data into MongoDB's `stockdb` database.

## Set Up Kafka

1. Configure Kafka for real-time streaming.
2. Ensure that your Kafka server, producer, and consumer are running properly.

## Run YCSB Benchmarking

1. Use the provided `ycsb_benchmark.sh` file to run benchmarking on MySQL and MongoDB.

```bash
./ycsb.sh
```
